## Ribbit | The forefront of amphibious web browsing

Ribbit is a Reddit-inspired forum application built with [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) and [Clerk.](https://clerk.com/)

It uses the [App router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions), [Server & Client components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components), the [new metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata), React.js [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), [cache()](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/caching#react-cache), [useFormStatus](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#experimental-useformstatus), and more new React 18/Next 13 features.

The goal for this project is to **learn and use all new features from Next 13**, coming from Next 12.
